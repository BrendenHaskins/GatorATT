                <p class="card-text">Hi, my name is Andrew, or Andy. I am just starting out in the BAS of Software Development, while working part time. I moved to Australia for one semester to attend university at Curtin University in Perth for a BAS in Computer Science. I ended up moving back early, because homesickness hit way harder than I expected it to. I enjoy working on my cars in my free time, although it&#39;s a love/hate thing.</p>

While it is a fun and rewarding job being able to help my patients to recover from injuries and become more independent with their own mobility while decreasing fall risk, but I decided to make a career change after discoering the potentials and room for growth in the tech industry.</p>
