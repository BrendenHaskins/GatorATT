            <p>Hi, my name is Andrew, or Andy. I am just starting out in the BAS of Software Development, while working part time. I moved to Australia for one semester to attend university at Curtin University in Perth for a BAS in Computer Science. I ended up moving back early, because homesickness hit way harder than I expected it to. I enjoy working on my cars in my free time, although it&#39;s a love/hate thing.</p>

            <p>Proud Green River Gator. Passionate software developer. Outside of tech, I am a multi-instrumentalist and love working on cars. For work, I do all sorts of things such as contracting, laboring, groundskeeping, and baking.</p>

            <p>I am a third-year student in the BAS Software development program, previously I was working as a Physical Therapist Assistant in Home Health and Skilled Nursing settings. While it is a fun and rewarding job being able to help my patients to recover from injuries and become more independent with their own mobility while decreasing fall risk, but I decided to make a career change after discoering the potentials and room for growth in the tech industry.</p>
